Polymorphism & Composition Homework Quiz

1. Polymorphism means the ability to take on many forms. One object can have multiple different forms.

2. An example of Polymorphism in Java would be a series of objects that utilise an interface of ISwim. These objects could be very different in everything else that they are able to do but by all utilising the ability to implement ISwim, they can be grouped together as instances of ISwim objects.

3. We can utilise interfaces to implement Polymorphism in Java.

4. An object can take as many forms as required when utilising Polymorphism as long as it implements some instance of the 'form' it is trying to take on.

5. The theme park lab from week 12. Attractions and Stalls are both very different objects in what they are required to do. But by implementing the ITicketed interface these two completely separate classes can be grouped together under one form.

## Composition ##

6. Composition is an improvement upon the principle of inheritance where instead of taking EVERYTHING that the parent class has attached to it and object can be COMPOSED of multiple different objects with their own attributes and methods.

7. An example of composition would be when modelling a car. Instead of all cars inheriting from a broader Vehicle class with vague attributes that weigh down the car object, we could COMPOSE the car of multiple different objects such as: an engine, tires, a steering wheel and a fuel tank.

8. Composition allows for more flexibility, you only compose with exactly what you need. You don't need to be tied to what a parent class has.

9. The behaviours are also destroyed as each COMPOSITION is unique.
